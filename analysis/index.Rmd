The purpose of this project is to gain some insight into city-wide
biking trends by analyzing the [Divvy trip
data](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data). I also analyze trip data
from one single bike station at the University of Chicago to compare the
biking patterns at the university against city-wide trends.

All the results and plots presented in the pages below should be
reproducable on your computer. First walk through the
[Setup Instructions](setup.html) if you are interested in reproducing
the results for yourself.

These are the results of my analyses. They were generated by rendering
the [R Markdown notebooks](https://github.com/pcarbo/wflow-divvy/tree/master/analysis)
into webpages.

1. [A first glance at the Divvy data](first-glance.html).

2. [A map of the Divvy stations in Chicago](station-map.html).

3. [Exploring daily bike commuting trends from the Divvy
data.](time-of-day-trends.html).

4. [Exploring seasonal biking trends from the Divvy
data.](seasonal-trends.html).
